# Understanding log4j Security Risks
Log4j is a popular logging framework for Java, but it is important to be aware of the security risks that can be associated with its use, especially in a production environment.
steps:
- Clone the repository
- Add log4j to your classpath
- configure log4j by adding log4j.properties file in the classpath.
- Call the setup method in NetworkLogger class in the main method of the class, where you want to use it.


## Injection Attacks

log4j allows developers to pass user-supplied input (such as a user name or IP address) to the logging functions. Hackers can exploit this by injecting malicious code into the input, which can then be executed when the log message is written. To mitigate this risk, validate user-supplied input and sanitize any user input before it is passed to log4j.

## File Inclusion Attacks

log4j allows developers to specify a file name for the log file, which is often based on user-supplied input. Hackers can exploit this by specifying a file path that points to a file outside of the intended directory, allowing them to read sensitive data or execute code. To mitigate this risk, validate the file path provided and ensure it is within the intended directory and only use file paths within that directory.

## File Path Traversal Attacks

If log4j doesn't properly validate user-supplied input when specifying a log file path, hackers can use the "../" directory traversal sequence to specify a file outside of the intended directory and read or write files they should not have access to. To mitigate this risk, validate the file path provided and ensure it is within the intended directory and only use file paths within that directory.

## Log Forging

 Logs are used to verify system behavior and some information is used to validate user's requests. Hackers can use log data to create false/fake log entries to bypass security or validation checks. To mitigate this risk, use proper access control mechanisms to limit who can read and write to the log files.
 
 ## Recommended Best Practices
 
- Validate user-supplied input when specifying a log file path
- Implement appropriate access controls
- Use a secure transport mechanism to move logs if they need to be sent to a remote location
- Stay informed about the latest security vulnerabilities and best practices

It is important to remember that log4j should be used with caution and it's important to stay informed about the latest security vulnerabilities and best practices for protecting your systems. It's also important to conduct regular security audits of your logging system to ensure that it is configured securely and that it continues to protect your systems as new vulnerabilities are discovered.


## The example provided:

This class is an example of how you can use log4j to log messages in your code. It has a basic structure of main method, where we have created an instance of this class and call the two methods doSomething() and doSomethingElse(String input). Both the methods are logging some messages using log4j. The doSomethingElse(String input) method is also doing validation on the input, in case the input is null or empty it's logging the error message.

It's important to note that the log4j.properties file should be configured properly and should be in the classpath. It's also important to validate and sanitize user-supplied input when using log4j, to prevent injection attacks, and implement appropriate access controls to prevent log forging.

Please keep in mind that this is just an example and you should adjust the code to suit the specific requirements of your project.

Also, please note that this code is just for demonstration purposes and you may need to modify it for your specific use case. Also, the examples in this README cover some common security risks, but it is by no means exhaustive and doesn't cover all possible scenarios. Regularly reviewing your code and staying informed about the latest security vulnerabilities are important steps in keeping your application secure.

## Example of how a hacker might exploit a log injection vulnerability:

![1E6AB0D8-F1A1-4239-8C99-605E58EF41C9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61942133/211728454-24392517-6a85-4473-814c-dc89ca7ec59f.jpeg)

In this example, the method doSomething(String input) is taking a string input and logging it using log4j. The input is not being sanitized before being passed to the log. In the main method, we call this method with a normal input and with a malicious input in which the hacker could inject arbitrary SQL commands. As a result, the malicious SQL command gets executed and the table "users" would be dropped.

This is just one example of how a hacker might use log4j to exploit a vulnerability. It's important to validate and sanitize user-supplied input when using log4j to prevent this type of attack, and to implement appropriate access controls to limit who can read and write to the log files. Also, it's important to keep your log4j library updated with the latest security patches, and stay informed about the latest security vulnerabilities and best practices.

It's important to note that this is just an example, and a real-world attack would be much more complex. Additionally, It's very important to not use the above-mentioned code in any production environment, it's just a demonstration of how log injection could be done.
